Longest Common subsequence:

Given two subsequences find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them
Subsequence = not contiguous (i.e not in order)

Recursive substructure:

c[i,j] = {

0 if i = 0 or j = 0
if i and j are > 0 c[i-1, j-1] + 1 and x = y
else max(c[i,j-1],c[i-1,j]) if i,j > 0 and x != y 


}
